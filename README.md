# Alx Interview

> Projects meant to simulate interview situations

This is a way of assessing a candidate's technical skills, knowledge, and problem-solving abilities related to a specific role or field or a generic way of gauging somoene's capabilties in various differing contexts. This could range from 1. engineering, data structures and algorithms, data science, to 2. generic/random computer programming problem sets.

Example scenarios;

    1. **Coding/Programming Assessment:** In software development a person is often asked to solve coding or programming problems. This may involve writing code on a whiteboard, coding on a computer, or using an online coding platform - to evaluate the candidate's problem-solving skills, algorithmic thinking, and coding proficiency.

    2. **Technical Questions:** Candidates may be asked a series of technical questions related to their field. These questions can range from fundamental concepts to more advanced topics. For example, a software engineer might be asked about data structures, algorithms, software design principles, or system architecture.

    3. **System Design:** Designing a complex maintainable/scalable system or discuss how they would architect a solution to a real-world problem.
