Certainly! Here's a short README.md file for the "Lockboxes" project:

# Lockboxes

## INFO 

To determine whether all the boxes in a `set` of locked boxes can be opened, considering that each box may contain keys to other boxes. The goal is to write a method, `canUnlockAll`, that checks if it's possible to unlock all the boxes.


## Usage

```python
$ ./main_0.py
True
True
False
```


## Function Context/Scope

The `canUnlockAll` function accepts a list of lists (`boxes`), where each inner list represents a box and contains keys to other boxes. It returns `True` if all boxes can be opened, and `False` otherwise. The algorithm could use depth-first search (DFS) to traverse the boxes and checks if all boxes can be visited.
